# CipherPrimitives

This Repository contains the various Cipher Primitives used in the development of Encryption Algorithms. They are all written in Java and are all excecutable independently. Have fun, Modify where necessary and feel free to critique and comment.

<H3>The primitives and Operations include:</H3>
<ol>
  <li> Arrays</li>
  <li> File to Bytes Conversion</li>
  <li> Hashing. (Currently set to MD5 But you can change to SHA1 or any other)</li>
  <li> IV Generator/Random Bytes Generator</li>
  <li> Byte Padding</li>
  <li> Byte Array revresing</li>
  <li> File bytes splitting and Concatenation</li>
  <li> Transpose</li>
  <li>. XOR</li>
</ol>

Using these modules and some good error handling you can be able to develop adequate encryption tools.
